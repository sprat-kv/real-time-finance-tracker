# npm resolution error report

While resolving: react-frontend@0.1.0
Found: react@19.0.0
node_modules/react
  react@"^19.0.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^18.0.0" from @testing-library/react@13.4.0
node_modules/@testing-library/react
  @testing-library/react@"^13.0.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
